# Enabling Machine Learning using Homomorphic Encryption
This the repository for the coursework submitted for the Applied Cryptography and Trust Module.

The documents in this repository are submissions for the completion of my coursework in Applied Cryptography and Trusr. The topic I chose for this work is 'Enabling Machine Learning using Homomorphic Encryption'.

Included are a pdf document alongwith two basic examples of homomorphic in the two popular machine learning software platforms Python and R.
